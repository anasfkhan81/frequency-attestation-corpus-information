# Word2Vec

https://github.com/tmikolov/word2vec

also cf. http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-word2vec/

(not necessary to put actual data here, we basically need to define the embedding method, the base corpus, the similarity metric [here, cosine]; beyond that, we only have two words and a double/float-value score as a result)

do we want to replicate algebraic operations? [I guess not]
